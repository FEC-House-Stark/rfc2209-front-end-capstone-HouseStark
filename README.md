# Atelier E-Commerce

Atelier E-Commerce is a product page for an e-commerce website. Users can browse product pictures and styles in the product overview, view and compare related products, interact with product questions and answers, and view, filter, and post reviews. This is the culmination of four engineers collaborating over the course of two weeks to build a webpage from a wireframe and specification document.

### Questions & Answers
>In this section, users can search, view, post, and interact with the product questions and answers.
In the search bar, users can type in keywords to filter the question list. Users can mark questions as helpful or report them to provide feedback. Users can also add a question or an answer to an existing question.
To improve the UX, the Q&A section by default shows no more than 2 questions and 2 answers, but users can expand and collapse a full view of the Questions and Answers lists.

### Reviews
>Users can sort reviews by helpfulness, date added, and relevance. Users can also add their own custom review. The breakdown section shows multiple graphs representing the ratings for the product. Review list is expandable to show more reviews if wanted.

### Stark Mode
>Instead of dark mode, we created _Stark Mode_. It was an opportunity to break from the clean, minimalist design and have a little fun with CSS.
